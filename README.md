FIRST AND FOREMOST!
My thanks to the AWESOME people at ADAFRUIT for making their code public! I am only modifying what they have already created!
There are SEVERAL others here on GITHUB that deserve credit as well. THEY CREATED THE CRAYONS! I am just coloring with them!  

I use an 8266 and two matrixes...
just playing around with the sample codes and see what I can do.
kind of molded two into one.
now I want smiley faces.. lol

UPCOMING
if I can... I wish to incorporate the WiFi...  still learning..
